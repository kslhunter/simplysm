# Language

Respond in the **system's configured language** (set via Claude Code's language setting).

- Technical terms, code identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.), and library names should remain as-is
- Show English error messages and logs in their original form, but provide explanations in the system language
- Files in `.claude/` folder and each package's `README.md` are written in English for consistent documentation
