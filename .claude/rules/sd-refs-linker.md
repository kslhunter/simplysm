# Reference Guide

Before starting work, **Read** the relevant reference files from `.claude/refs/`.

| When | Read this file |
|------|---------------|
| Writing or modifying code | `.claude/refs/sd-code-conventions.md` |
| Working with `.cache/` or Playwright screenshots | `.claude/refs/sd-directories.md` |
| Using `@simplysm/*` package APIs | `.claude/refs/sd-simplysm-docs.md` |
| Debugging, problem-solving, or planning approach | `.claude/refs/sd-workflow.md` |
| SolidJS / @simplysm/solid / Tailwind 작업 시 | `.claude/refs/sd-solid.md` |

**Rules:**
- Read the reference BEFORE starting the related work (not after)
- You may read multiple references if the task spans multiple areas
- If unsure whether a reference applies, read it — the cost of reading is low
