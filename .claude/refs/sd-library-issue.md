# Simplysm Library Issue Reporting

Source code for `@simplysm/*` packages can be found in `node_modules/@simplysm/`. If debugging reveals the root cause is in the simplysm library itself, generate a GitHub issue-formatted text (title, reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior) and display it to the user.

**Report facts only — do not suggest fixes or include code location hints. Do not auto-submit the issue — only display the text.**

The issue body must NEVER include internal analysis of library code (class names, variable names, style properties, inheritance chains, etc.). Only describe user-observable symptoms.
